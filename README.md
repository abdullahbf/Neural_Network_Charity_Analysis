# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Purpose/Objective:

The objective was to use neural networks to develop a binary classifier that could help in predicting charity success if funded. 

## Results:

AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb contains the first model designed. 

Target variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL

Columns removed: EIN, NAME 

Features for the model: Rest of the columns
